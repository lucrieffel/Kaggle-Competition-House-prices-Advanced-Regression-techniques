# Kaggle-Competition-House-prices-Advanced-Regression-techniques
Project Overview: 

In this competition, I used a random forest regressor in order to predict the sale price of a house based on 81 features. The dataset was large and I used a few different methods to clean my data and prepare it for my regressor. After building the model I used both randomized search cv and grid search cv in order to tune the parameters of my model to maximize accuracy. I then ran my model against the test dataset and submitted my predictions to kaggle for a score.
